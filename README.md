# Binary Classifier
[in process...]\
I first created this project to help me to understand how to construct a Neural Network through a mathematical point of view, without deep learning frameworks.

To go further in my deep learning training (pun intended), I've been working on a 4-step project to also get used to deep learning frameworks (such as Tensorflow and Pytorch) and get a better understanding of a DL project and be able to link the framework API with my DL knowledge through NumPy.

In this 4-step project, I built an binary image classifier for Pokemon through various methods with various complexities. Disclaimer : since this project is base on apprehending the global structur of a NN, the statistical performances are left behind (for example, I am aware that my datasets are not large enough). 

### Project :

- Built a binary classifier from scratch with the NumPy library
- Built a binary classifier with Tensorflow (this is the baseline, taken from [Anis Ayari's repository](https://github.com/anisayari/Youtube-apprendre-le-deeplearning-avec-tensorflow/tree/master/%234%20-%20CNN))
- Built a binary classifier with Pytorch in a sequential way
- Built a binary classifier with Pytorch in a more advance way
