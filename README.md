# Binary Classifier

I've first created this project to help me to understand the construction of a Neural Network through a mathematical point of view, without deep learning frameworks to get a better understanding of a DL project and be able to link the common frameworks with my DL knowledge through NumPy.

I've been working on this project based on the [DeepLearning.AI specialization course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng. Also, I've taken the idea from the [Anis Ayari's repository](https://github.com/anisayari/Youtube-apprendre-le-deeplearning-avec-tensorflow/tree/master/%234%20-%20CNN) which deals with binary classification with TensorFlow.

I've built a binary image classifier for Pokemon through various methods with various complexities.\
_Disclaimer : since this project is based on apprehending the global structure of a NN, the statistical performances are left behind (for example, I am aware that my datasets are not large enough)._
